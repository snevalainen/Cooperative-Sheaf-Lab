THE SHAPE OF AGREEMENT: REFERENCE IMPLEMENTATION

Operationalizing Sheaf Theory for Cooperative Logistics.

This repository contains the reference implementation (Volume II) for 
the protocol defined in the monograph The Shape of Agreement. It 
provides the Stitching Layer necessary to transform heterogeneous 
supply chain data into a coherent Simplicial Complex. It utilizes 
Large Language Models as topological restriction maps.

📂 REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

• orchestrator.py: The backend daemon that performs the Observe Orient 
Decide Acta loop. It manages the H0 (Consensus) and H1 (Waste) streams.
• app.py: The One Drop Dashboard. A Streamlit based interface for 
visualizing the Sheaf Cohomology of incoming data packets.
• requirements.txt: Dependency manifest.

📚 TECHNICAL DOCUMENTATION AND PROVENANCE

This research formalizes the shift from adversarial, DAG based 
logistics to a cooperative, Sheaf theoretic framework. It introduces 
the Thermodynamic Mandate for global economic alignment.

⚠️ NOTICE: PROPRIETARY IMPLEMENTATION AND CORE AUTOMATION

While this project provides an open source framework for the 
Quaternionic Sheaf Laplacian (defined in the Technical Glossary 
and Mathematical Basis of the GitBook). The following components 
are proprietary and excluded from this repository.

1. THE STITCHING LAYER SEEDS. The deterministic basis generation 
   algorithms and salt distribution protocols used for production 
   grade data obfuscation.
2. GLOBAL SECTION RESOLVERS. The private and high performance Slerp 
   optimizers used to align multi party logistic networks at scale.
3. LEGACY ADAPTER INTERFACES. The secure handshake protocols 
   designed for specific Tier 1 ERP and TMS integrations.

The mathematical definitions provided herein are for academic 
validation and interoperability testing. Production grade 
deployment requires access to the White Piece Core Engine. For 
institutional partnership or pilot inquiries. Please contact 
the Architect.

🧠 THEORETICAL BASIS

This code implements the Cooperative Sheaf Protocol.
• Input. Unstructured text or CSV from a supply chain node.
• Restriction Map (ρ). An LLM converts input to a strict JSON Schema.
• Cohomology Check. If data fits the schema, it signals H0 (Agreement). 
  If data fails, it signals H1 (Waste).
• Auditor. Automated repair logic is applied to the Waste Stream.
